## Description

### Mini-tutorials

The Jupyter notebooks in the `mini_tutorials` folder are tutorials intended as introductory material to introduce concepts and basic sample code exercises to students enrolled in a Data Science course. Students were expected to read through the content and code exercises to prepare for the interactive guided lesson that followed.

### Cybersecurity

The content in the `cyber_security` folder is for a Introductory Cybersecurity course. Each tutorial would have covered material for a four-day "sprint" and is intended to prepare students to participate in a guided lesson where they apply the concepts introduced in the tutorial.

### Projects

The Jupyter notebooks in the `personal_projects` folder were written for a personal blog. They are intended as stand-alone tutorials that guide the reader through a complete analysis.
