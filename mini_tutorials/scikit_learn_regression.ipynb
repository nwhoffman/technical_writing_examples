    "In the previous objectives, we used `seaborn` to fit a simple linear regression to a dataset containing penguin weight and flipper lengths. In the example, we compared our baseline (the ratio of weight to flipper length) to the actual best-line fit in the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this unit we're going to be using the tools available in the scikit-learn library. Most likely, you've already come across this library and even used some of the tools, either in Unit 1 or during your own learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, we're going to work through an example using scikit-learn to fit a linear regression model, using the same dataset from the previous objective. While some of this material may be review, it's still important to go through each of the steps, both for practice and to address concepts that we might have missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into how to use scikit-learn to fit a model, we'll do a quick review of linear regression and the associated coefficients. A linear regression fits data to a line where the equation of the line is given by \n",

    "\n",
    "In the next objective, we'll focus more on the meaning of the coefficients. Right now, the goal is to learn how to use the scikit-learn tool to fit a simple model."

    "\n",
    "### Load Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous objective, we'll use the penguin data set available from the `seaborn` library. When we import `seaborn`, all of the associated datasets are included; we don't need to download any other data or load files from our local system.\n",
    "\n",

The rows are sometimes called samples; think of each row as a sample of observations about a penguin. We also have seven columns that correspond to the information that describes each sample. Here, we are describing the species, home island, and physical characters of our samples (penguins). Features are often numeric (`body_mass_g`, `flipper_length_mm`) but not always; the `species`, `island`, and `sex` columns are all described by string variables.\n",
